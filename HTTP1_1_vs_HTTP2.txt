HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

HTTP/1.1:
--------
 ->It usesd works on the textual format.
 ->There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources
 ->It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
 ->It compresses data by itself.
         
 HTTP/2:
 ------ 
        HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format. it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. it compresses the header. The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.        
->It works on the binary protocol.
->It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
->It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
->It uses HPACK for data compression.   

Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are 
quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that 
while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, 
in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
